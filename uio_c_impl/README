A second C userspace implementation of a PCI driver for the Intel Precise Touch; as found in the Microsoft Surface Pro 4.
**N.B.** this is currently not usable and in the reverse engineering stage

Status: 

- Initialisation of PCI device  0000:16.4 done (based on KVM-vfio captures)
- Enable interrupts (Seems to work....)
- Reading region0 memory map (Should work) 
- Decode the intel precise protocole (The hard part, NOT DONE) 

Files: 

- Makefile  
- init_modules => Bash script to load uio modules and bind the device 
- precise-uio.c => The driver
- vfio.c => Another C attempt (nevermind)
- logs/vm-precise-capture.log
- logs/log_parser.pl


How to run: 

$ su - 
# ./init_modules
# ./precise-uio

How to decode logs

# cd logs
# cat kvm-precise-capture.log | ./log_parser.pl
